# Pterodactyl Installer Script

With the pterodactyl installation script you can install pterodactyl with a click on enter or set everything up exactly the way you want

## Features

- You can install everything separately or everything at once, such as just the panel, just the wings, or just phpMyAdmin, or the panel and the wings, or all at once; almost everything is possible! (If something isn't possible that you would like to be possible, please let us know and perhaps it will be included)
- You have the option to remove components such as the panel, wings, or phpMyAdmin.
- The Node is automatically connected
